Welcome to my Capstone Project! As a huge basketball fan, I've always been fascinated by the never-ending debate: who is the greatest player of all time‚ÄîLeBron James or Michael Jordan? This project dives deep into the stats, using data analysis and visualization to explore the differences in their careers. Whether you're Team LeBron, Team Jordan, or just love the game, I hope this project offers some interesting insights into this heavily debated topic!
